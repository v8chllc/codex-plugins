name: remember
description: "Load existing project memory, set up memory storage, record structured memories, or capture session notes across three lanes: daily journal, curated memory, and procedural memory. Trigger when: user says 'remember [type] [content]' or 'remember that [content]'; user invokes $remember with or without args; user invokes $remember setup, $remember session, $remember procedure, $remember workflow, $remember standard, or $remember review; user says 'setup remember', 'remember in this project', or 'initialize memory here'. For /recommend commands use the recommend skill."

# Remember Skill

Manages three memory lanes for the current working directory:

1. **Daily Journal** — episodic session notes in `.remember/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. **Curated Memory** — durable structured entries in `.remember/MEMORY.md`
3. **Procedural Memory** — behavior-changing guidance in approved agent-facing targets

See `references/types.md` for curated memory type templates and examples.
See `references/agents-md-directive.md` for the legacy generated directive block
that setup may remove from `AGENTS.md` only by exact match.
See `references/journal-format.md` for journal entry format and dedupe marker spec.
See `references/procedural-targets.md` for the approved procedural target allowlist.
Use `scripts/validate_memory.py` for deterministic memory validation, JSON
reporting, and setup-aware Memory Fast-Track steering checks.

---

## Trigger patterns

**Manual load — any of:**
- `$remember` (no args)

**Setup — any of:**
- `$remember setup`
- Natural language: "setup remember", "remember in this project", "initialize memory here"

**Validation:**
- `$remember validate`
- `$remember validate --json`
- Natural language: "validate remember", "validate memory"

**Journal write:**
- `$remember session`
- Natural language: "capture this session", "write to journal"

**Recommend:** use the `recommend` skill (`/recommend session`, `/recommend curated`, `/recommend procedural`).

**Review — slash command or natural language:**
- `$remember review`
- "review memory", "audit memories", "clean up remember"

**Procedural write:**
- `$remember procedure <text>`
- `$remember workflow <text>`
- `$remember standard <text>`

**Record — slash command:**
- `$remember entity <identifier>`
- `$remember decision <text>`
- `$remember error <text>`
- `$remember context <text>`
- `$remember preference <text>`
- `$remember todo <text>`

**Record — natural language (auto-invoke):**
- "Remember the entity `<identifier>`"
- "Remember the decision `<text>`"
- "Remember the error `<text>`"
- "Remember the context `<text>`"
- "Remember the preference `<text>`"
- "Remember the todo `<text>`"
- "Remember that `<text>`" — type inferred from content

---

## Workflow A: Manual Load / Status

Triggered by `$remember` with no args.

1. Check whether `.remember/MEMORY.md` and `.remember/memory/` exist in cwd.
   - If either is missing: report that memory is not initialized and tell the
     user to run `$remember setup`. Do not create files.
2. Read `.remember/MEMORY.md`.
3. Compute today's journal path, `.remember/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, using the
   current local date.
4. If today's journal file exists, read it. If not, report that no journal file
   exists for today.
5. Respond with a concise status report:
   - durable memory loaded from `.remember/MEMORY.md`
   - today's journal loaded or absent
   - optional procedural targets present or missing:
     `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md`,
     `WORKFLOW_STANDARDS.md`

## Workflow B: Setup

Triggered by `$remember setup` or natural language setup phrases.

### Core memory setup

1. Create `.remember/` in cwd if it is missing.
2. Create `.remember/memory/` for the journal lane if it is missing.
3. If `.remember/MEMORY.md` is missing, write this stub:

```
# Memory

<!-- This file is read by Codex at the start of every session.         -->
<!-- Use $remember to record entries, or edit directly.                  -->
<!-- Types: entity | decision | error | context | preference | todo      -->

## entity

## decision

## context

## error

## preference

## todo
```

4. If `AGENTS.md` exists, compare its `## Memory` section to
   `references/agents-md-directive.md`.
   - If the section exactly matches the reference content, remove that generated
     section from `AGENTS.md`.
   - If a `## Memory` section exists but differs from the reference content,
     leave it unchanged and report that manual review is needed.
   - If no `## Memory` section exists, leave `AGENTS.md` unchanged.
5. Do not create `AGENTS.md` and do not inject a memory-load directive.
6. Confirm to the user with a summary of files created, existing files reused,
   directive cleanup performed, and any manual review needed.
7. Run validation and steering detection from the repository root:
   `python plugins/v8ch/skills/remember/scripts/validate_memory.py --root . --toolchain codex --check-steering`.
   Report the validation status and issues. Validation must not mutate files.
8. If `AGENTS.md` is missing a `## Memory Fast-Track Workflow` section, report
   the gap and ask whether to append generated Codex-appropriate guidance.
   Apply it only after user approval with:
   `python plugins/v8ch/skills/remember/scripts/validate_memory.py --root . --toolchain codex --apply-fast-track`.
   If `AGENTS.md` has related but non-matching fast-track guidance, avoid
   destructive edits and ask for manual review or explicit approval.

### Status report

After core memory is confirmed present, inspect and report:

- **Journal lane**: is `.remember/memory/` present? List today's journal file if it exists.
- **Procedural targets**: for each of `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md`, `WORKFLOW_STANDARDS.md` — present or missing? Report as optional managed targets. Do not create them automatically; offer stubs only on request.
- **Validation**: summarize pass/fail counts and actionable issues from
  `scripts/validate_memory.py`.
- **Memory Fast-Track steering**: report present, missing, added after approval,
  skipped, or manual-review-needed.

---

## Workflow C: Record (typed)

Triggered by `$remember <type> <content>` or natural language equivalent.

1. **Guard**: check `.remember/MEMORY.md` and `.remember/memory/` exist. If
   either is missing, tell the user to run `$remember setup` first and stop.
2. **Resolve type**: from explicit arg or inferred from natural language phrasing.
3. **Gather content**:
   - `entity`: search the codebase for `<identifier>` (grep/glob for class, function, or file). Fill template fields from what is found. Confirm with user before writing.
   - `decision`: use provided text. If no date is given, use today's date. Ask for `Rationale` if not supplied.
   - `error`, `context`, `preference`: use provided text. Fill template fields. Ask for missing required fields if content is too sparse.
   - `todo`: use provided text. If no date is given, use today's date. Ask for `Next action` if not supplied. Set `Status: open` by default.
4. **Duplicate check**: search `.remember/MEMORY.md` for an existing entry with the same name or subject. If found, offer to update in place rather than append.
5. Append (or update) the entry under the correct `## <type>` section using the template from `references/types.md`.
6. Confirm to user: type recorded, subject, and whether it was added or updated.

---

## Workflow D: Inferred type

Triggered by "Remember that `<text>`" with no explicit type keyword.

1. Read `<text>` and classify as one of: `entity`, `decision`, `error`, `context`, `preference`, `todo`.
2. Tell the user: "I'll record this as a `<type>`. Does that look right?"
3. On confirmation: continue as Workflow C from step 3.
4. On rejection: ask the user to specify the type, then continue as Workflow C from step 3.

---

## Workflow E: Journal Write (`$remember session`)

Triggered by `$remember session` or natural language journal phrases.

1. **Guard**: check `.remember/MEMORY.md` and `.remember/memory/` exist. If
   either is missing, tell the user to run `$remember setup` first and stop.
2. Compute a best-effort `session_hash` from available context. See `references/journal-format.md` for the approach.
3. Read today's journal file (`.remember/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) if it exists; scan for an existing marker with the same hash.
4. If hash found → skip (dedupe). Notify user that this session was already captured.
5. If hash not found → compose a journal entry covering: what happened, key context, decisions considered, blockers, next steps, and useful references. Append entry with HTML comment metadata marker. See `references/journal-format.md` for the format.
6. Confirm to user: file path written, or skipped with reason.

---

## Workflow F: Recommend Curated

Invoked by the `recommend` skill (`/recommend curated`).

1. **Guard**: check `.remember/MEMORY.md` and `.remember/memory/` exist. If
   either is missing, tell the user to run `$remember setup` first.
2. Review current session context.
3. Identify durable curated candidates:
   - `decision`: explicit technical or workflow choices and their rationale.
   - `error`: failure modes, fixes, gotchas, or validation issues discovered.
   - `context`: current project state, active work, blockers, or next steps.
   - `preference`: repeated or explicit user working preferences.
   - `entity`: important codebase objects discussed in enough detail to locate and describe.
4. Exclude ephemeral information: one-off commands, transient status, vague observations, unconfirmed guesses, or facts already covered.
5. Compare candidates against `.remember/MEMORY.md`. Mark each as `add`, `update`, or `skip`. Prefer updating the existing `context` entry.
6. Present recommendations only; do not write automatically.
7. For each recommendation include: action, type, subject, reason it is durable, proposed entry text using the template from `references/types.md`.
8. Ask which to apply. On approval, continue through Workflow C from duplicate check.
9. Before writing approved entries, run validation:
   `python plugins/v8ch/skills/remember/scripts/validate_memory.py --root . --toolchain codex`.
   If validation fails, report the issues and do not write unless the user
   explicitly confirms proceeding despite the malformed memory state.

---

## Workflow G: Recommend Session

Invoked by the `recommend` skill (`/recommend session`).

1. **Guard**: check `.remember/MEMORY.md` and `.remember/memory/` exist. If
   either is missing, tell the user to run `$remember setup` first.
2. Run journal write logic (Workflow E steps 2–6) as a prerequisite. If already captured (dedupe), skip silently and continue.
3. Review the captured journal entry and full session context.
4. Identify curated candidates (entity, decision, error, context, preference) and procedural candidates (workflow lessons, coding/arch standards, skill/tool routines).
5. Resolve each procedural candidate to an approved target from `references/procedural-targets.md`. If no target fits, mark as unsupported.
6. Dedupe curated candidates against `.remember/MEMORY.md`; dedupe procedural candidates against their respective target files.
7. Present recommendations grouped by target and action: `add`, `update`, `skip`. List unsupported procedural candidates separately with a note.
8. Apply only approved changes. For curated approvals, continue through Workflow C. For procedural approvals, continue through Workflow I.
9. Before applying approved curated or procedural changes, run validation:
   `python plugins/v8ch/skills/remember/scripts/validate_memory.py --root . --toolchain codex`.
   If validation fails, report the issues and do not write unless the user
   explicitly confirms proceeding despite the malformed memory state.

---

## Workflow H: Recommend Procedural

Invoked by the `recommend` skill (`/recommend procedural`).

1. **Guard**: check `.remember/MEMORY.md` and `.remember/memory/` exist. If
   either is missing, tell the user to run `$remember setup` first.
2. Review current session context and today's journal file if present.
3. Identify procedural candidates only: workflow lessons, coding/arch standards, skill/tool routines.
4. Resolve each to an approved target from `references/procedural-targets.md`. If no target fits, mark as unsupported; do not write elsewhere.
5. Read existing guidance in each resolved target file.
6. Classify candidates as `add`, `update`, or `skip` against the file's current content.
7. Propose a concise patch per target. Present for user review.
8. Apply only approved changes (Workflow I).
9. Before applying approved procedural changes, run validation:
   `python plugins/v8ch/skills/remember/scripts/validate_memory.py --root . --toolchain codex`.
   If validation fails, report the issues and do not write unless the user
   explicitly confirms proceeding despite the malformed memory state.

---

## Workflow I: Procedural Write (`$remember procedure/workflow/standard <text>`)

Triggered by `$remember procedure <text>`, `$remember workflow <text>`, or `$remember standard <text>`.

1. **Guard**: check `.remember/MEMORY.md` and `.remember/memory/` exist. If
   either is missing, tell the user to run `$remember setup` first and stop.
2. Parse `<text>` and resolve to an approved target file using `references/procedural-targets.md`.
   - If text maps clearly to one target: proceed.
   - If ambiguous: present candidates and ask the user to choose.
   - If no target fits: surface as unsupported; ask for explicit user direction. Do not write elsewhere.
3. Read existing guidance in the resolved target file. Check for duplication.
4. Propose the addition or update as a patch and present it to the user.
5. On approval: write the change. Prefer updating existing guidance over appending duplicate rules.
6. If the target file does not exist: offer to create it with a stub before writing. Create only on approval.

---

## Workflow J: Review (`$remember review`)

Triggered by `$remember review`, "review memory", "audit memories", or "clean up remember".

1. **Guard**: check `.remember/MEMORY.md` and `.remember/memory/` exist. If
   either is missing, tell the user to run `$remember setup` first.
2. Read `.remember/MEMORY.md` and collect all entries across every type section.
3. For each entry, classify as one of:
   - `retain`: still accurate and useful.
   - `remove`: stale, duplicated, obsolete, superseded, or no longer actionable.
   - `act`: requires follow-up.
4. Apply type-specific review criteria:
   - `entity`: retain if the code object still exists and remains important; remove if deleted, renamed without update, duplicated, or too trivial; act if documentation or dependencies need updating.
   - `decision`: retain if the rationale is still valid; remove if superseded or contradicted by a newer decision; act if implementation or documentation appears incomplete.
   - `error`: retain if the failure mode may recur; remove if obsolete (resolved and unlikely to recur); act if status is `watch` and there is an unresolved mitigation.
   - `context`: retain only if current; remove or update if stale. Collapse duplicates; flag extras for removal.
   - `preference`: retain unless contradicted by a newer preference; remove duplicates or overly narrow one-off preferences.
   - `todo`: retain if still valid; remove if `done`, `obsolete`, or duplicated; act if `open` or `blocked` and specific enough to become a work item.
5. For `todo` entries classified as `act`, propose new work items (title, description, suggested tracking mechanism). Do not create automatically.
6. Respond with a concise summary: total entries reviewed, counts per classification, memories to remove, memories to act upon, proposed work items.
7. Ask which removals and actions to apply. On approval: remove entries, create work items if requested, update `todo` entries with the `Work item` field.

---

## Workflow K: Validate (`$remember validate`)

Triggered by `$remember validate`, `$remember validate --json`, "validate
remember", or "validate memory".

1. Run `scripts/validate_memory.py` from the repository root:
   - Human-readable: `python plugins/v8ch/skills/remember/scripts/validate_memory.py --root . --toolchain codex --check-steering`
   - JSON: `python plugins/v8ch/skills/remember/scripts/validate_memory.py --root . --toolchain codex --check-steering --json`
2. Validation checks `.remember/MEMORY.md` for required type sections, known
   entry markers, required fields, and duplicate active `context` entries.
3. Validation checks `.remember/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` journal filenames and
   `remember-journal` metadata blocks.
4. Validation reports issues without mutating files by default. Only append
   generated Memory Fast-Track steering after explicit user approval with
   `--apply-fast-track`.
5. JSON output includes overall `status`, `counts`, and `issues` containing
   `severity`, `code`, `path`, `message`, and optional `suggested_fix`.
6. Respond with the helper output and a concise next action for any failures.

---

## Edge cases

- **Unknown type in args**: "Remember the widget `<text>`" — treat as Workflow D, infer type from content.
- **Empty subject on record command**: `$remember entity` with no identifier — ask the user to provide the subject.
- **`AGENTS.md` absent**: do not create it during setup.
- **No durable curated recommendations**: say no memory-worthy updates were found; do not modify files.
- **Procedural candidate with no approved target**: surface as unsupported; present to the user as a manual decision rather than writing elsewhere.
